This repo contains my collected notes and some sample files for the various in-class projects we've done up to this point. 
It's definitely possible that I've missed a step or two here or there but this should at a minimum help point in the general direction of how to accomplish the end goal for each one.

#### Setting up
[This](https://github.com/cdfisher/googlecloud_labs/tree/master/setting_up) covers most of the steps required to set up for each of the labs below.
#### Compute Engine
I don't have any notes for these since they were pretty straightforward.

#### App Engine/Cloud SQL
